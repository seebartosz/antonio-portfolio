## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Replit Integration**: Configured for Replit development environment
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for fast development iteration
- **Environment Variables**: Database URL and configuration via env vars

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Static Assets**: Frontend assets served by Express in production

### Production Deployment
- **Node.js Server**: Express serves both API routes and static files
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon Database serverless
- **Environment**: Production mode with optimized builds

### Content Management
- **Static Content**: All portfolio content is hardcoded for performance
- **Personal Information**: Easily updatable through component props
- **Responsive Assets**: Images and icons optimized for different screen sizes

## Technical Decisions

### React Over Plain HTML
- **Rationale**: Enables component reusability, state management, and modern development practices
- **Benefits**: Type safety with TypeScript, hot reload, modern tooling
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly larger bundle size but better maintainability

### Tailwind CSS Design System
- **Rationale**: Rapid development with consistent design tokens
- **Benefits**: Utility-first approach, responsive design, dark mode support
- **Implementation**: Custom color palette, component variants, responsive breakpoints

### Monolithic Frontend
- **Rationale**: Simple deployment and development for portfolio site
- **Benefits**: Single codebase, shared components, consistent styling
- **Future**: Could be split into separate apps if scaling requirements change

### No Authentication System
- **Rationale**: Portfolio site doesn't require user authentication
- **Current State**: Contact form submission (placeholder for external service)
- **Future**: Could add admin panel for content management if needed
